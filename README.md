# Simple CNN Example with TensorFlow

This repository demonstrates the three core steps in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) workflow before classification:

- Convolution  
- Pooling  
- Flattening

The code uses TensorFlow to build and visualize a simple CNN model.

## How to run

1. Create a virtual environment (to keep the system safe):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  
```

On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook cnn_simple.ipynb
```
